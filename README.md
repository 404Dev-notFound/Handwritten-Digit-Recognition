# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project demonstrates a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. It’s a beginner-friendly project to understand neural networks and image classification.

## 📌 Features

- Trained on the MNIST dataset
- Uses a neural network for digit classification
- Simple and clean implementation in Python
- Great for beginners in ML and AI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- NumPy  
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch if you used it)  
- Matplotlib (for visualizing results)  

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load the MNIST dataset (images + labels)
2. Normalize and preprocess the data
3. Train a neural network model
4. Evaluate model accuracy
5. Predict digits from test images

## 🖼️ Sample Output

> Include sample prediction screenshots or console output if available  
> Example:  
> `Predicted: 7 | Actual: 7 ✅`
